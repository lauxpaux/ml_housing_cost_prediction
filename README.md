# ml_housing_cost_prediction
A repository following the tutorial from chapter 2 of  "Hands-on Machine Learning". 


As an aspiring machine learning engineer, the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow" is a must and highly recommended from NASA mentors, fellow interns and other sources. This repository includes building the first model, an introductin to ML where we train a model to predict housing prices in California from an older data set, as one can see from the prices of the homes.
